# mugGrab

This is my first attempt at a node.js application.
The intended functionality is to either create a list of all mugshots or to append data to an already present list.

The scraped information will be used in further projects to expand my personal knowledge. Feel free to modify and re-upload anything you see fit. If you have any suggestions feel free to submit a pull-request or issue ticket, can't guarantee I'll get around to them, however.

Requirements include: 
Node.js
Node Package Managera
Phantom
